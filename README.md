## What is this?

It's an example repo I used to teach a workshop about React Query!

- The `main` branch contains the initial code we started with
- The `with-react-query` branch contains the code we ended with after adding `react-query`
- The #2 PR currently open in the repo shows the changes between the two

## How do I develop on this?

- Run `yarn` and then `yarn dev` locally.
- The Next.js API server is an in-memory local server, so the data is not actually persisted to disk. The posts that are stored or altered will be reset when the server restarts or when a file is saved and the server is recompiled.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
